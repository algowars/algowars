Algowars core application

## Setup

in the root directory run the following commands:

`npm run install:all`

This runs the commands `install:backend` and `install:client`. This will clean install the required dependencies in the backend and client.

Next fill out the env variables.

Lastly, you can now run

`npm ci`

Do this in the root directory so you can use concurrently to run the monolith application.

Now you can start the server by running:

`npm run dev`
