## Files Overview

### `src/account/db/account.schema.ts`

This file defines the schema for the account entity, which includes the structure and validation rules for account data.

### `src/account/db/account-dto.repository.ts`

This repository handles data transfer object (DTO) operations related to the account, including methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting account records.

### `src/account/db/account-dto.repository.spec.ts`

This file contains tests for the `AccountDtoRepository`. The tests ensure that the repository functions correctly, covering all CRUD operations and data handling logic.

### `src/account/db/account-entity.repository.ts`

This repository manages entity operations related to the account, interacting directly with the database to perform CRUD operations on account records.

### `src/account/db/account-entity.repository.spec.ts`

This file includes tests for the `AccountEntityRepository`. The tests validate the repository's methods and ensure they interact correctly with the database.

### `src/account/db/account-schema.factory.ts`

This factory class is responsible for creating instances of the account schema. It encapsulates the logic for generating new account objects based on the defined schema.

### `src/account/db/account-schema.factory.spec.ts`

This file provides tests for the `AccountSchemaFactory`. The tests verify that the factory correctly creates instances of the account schema and adheres to the expected structure and rules.
